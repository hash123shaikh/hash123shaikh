# 👋 Hi, I'm Hasan Shaikh  
*AI Researcher in Cancer Imaging | Radiomics & Deep Learning | Data Scientist at the **Quantitative Imaging Research and Artificial Intelligence Lab (QIRAIL)**, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore*

🔬 I'm deeply committed to solving **real-world healthcare challenges** through Artificial Intelligence. My primary focus lies in developing **predictive models** and **automated segmentation pipelines** for medical imaging, especially in **Head and Neck Cancer (HNC)**. I work extensively with **radiomics**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** to push the boundaries of clinical research.

With a strong belief in the **translational impact** of AI, my goal is to bridge the gap between engineering and clinical practice — ensuring that data-driven solutions reach the patient bedside.
